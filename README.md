# Henry's Password Generator

Often times we fall victim to hacking of our passwords because they are not 'strong' or 'secure' enough. This password generator gives us strong and secure random passwords.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Reactjs (Hooks like states and effects)

## What I Learnt on the project

    I learnt how to 'copy to clipboard' using an npm package and also how to impliment this package after importation

```js
<CopyToClipboard text={password}>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-clone" onClick={copyPasswordHandler}></i>
</CopyToClipboard>
```

## Roadmap

- When the page loads, click on 'Generate Password'.
- Click the clone icon on the right which will copy the password to your clipboard.
